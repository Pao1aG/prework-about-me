      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am community nutrition educator and I have a Masters in Public Health. This year I provided my team with technical assistance and modified our lessons and materials for an online format. My experience with technology this year encouraged me to explore the software field.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born and raised in Nogales, Sonora Mexico and came to the U.S. as a kid. I have now been living in Tucson since 2011 when I came to study at the University of Arizona.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love gardening, cooking, and watching lots of films and TV shows with my fiance</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?.</h1>
      <p> I am still figuring that out but I envision myself helping code programs for the cool technology in the film industry that makes the magic come to life</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>In front of my computer...In sunny Tucson.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I think working in this field will give me the opportunity to use both my creativity and problem-solving skills in a way that will be continuously rewarding. I also like the aspect of continuing to develop my skills and apply them in a job setting and for passion projects.</p>
